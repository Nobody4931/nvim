# Neovim Config v3

A modern rewrite of my programming setup for Neovim, focused on:

* **Simplicity:** Uses a minimal number of plugins for a gentler learning curve yet still providing a complete programming environment
* **Efficiency:** Takes advantage of lazy loading to optimize startup times by loading only absolutely necessary plugins
* **Portability:** Includes a bootstrapper that automatically installs required plugins and dependencies to ensure full functionality on first boot
* **Extensibility:** Utilizes a carefully modularized and organized file structure to make adding and removing features quick and simple
